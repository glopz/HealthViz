### 1. What is the purpose of the HealthViz package?

The **HealthViz** package is designed to simplify the analysis and visualization of health data, particularly in the fields of public health and epidemiology. It provides easy-to-use functions for generating epidemic curves, calculating prevalence rates, and assessing risk ratios.

---

### 2. What are the key features of HealthViz?

The **HealthViz** package includes the following features:
- **Epidemic Curve Visualization**: Tracks case counts over time using customizable intervals.
- **Prevalence Rate Calculation**: Calculates and visualizes prevalence rates across categories or time periods.
- **Risk Ratio Evaluation**: Computes and visualizes the risk ratios for exposure-outcome relationships.

---

### 3. What dependencies are required to use HealthViz?

The **HealthViz** package relies on the following R packages:
- **ggplot2**: For data visualization.
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation.
- **rlang**: Provides tools for programming with R, including handling tidy evaluation and creating custom error messages.

Ensure these dependencies are installed before using HealthViz.

### 4. How do I install the HealthViz package?
```{r}
#You can install the HealthViz package directly from GitHub using the `devtools` package. Follow these steps:

# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install HealthViz from GitHub
devtools::install_github("glopez/HealthViz")
#After installation, load the package with library(HealthViz)
```
5. How can I learn to use the functions in HealthViz?
Each function in HealthViz is well-documented. You can use R's built-in ?epidemic_curve
?epidemic_curve
?prevalence_rate
?risk_ratio
Each help file provides a detailed description of the function, its parameters, and usage examples.
6. Can I use my own datasets with HealthViz?
All functions in HealthViz are designed to work with user-provided datasets. Ensure your dataset is properly formatted (e.g., column names match the expected parameter names). For example:

epidemic_curve expects columns for dates and case counts.
prevalence_rate requires columns for grouping variables and outcomes.
7. What types of visualizations does HealthViz generate?
The HealthViz package generates high-quality, publication-ready visualizations, including:

Bar plots for epidemic curves and prevalence rates.
Risk ratio bar plots comparing exposed and unexposed groups.
All plots are created using ggplot2 for flexibility and customization.

8. Who can benefit from using HealthViz?
The HealthViz package is designed for:

Public health professionals.
Epidemiologists.
Researchers analyzing health data.
Educators teaching data analysis and visualization in health-related fields.
It is also suitable for students learning health data analysis.

9. Are there any limitations to HealthViz?
Currently, HealthViz focuses on:

Visualization and descriptive analysis of health data.
Functions for basic epidemiological tasks.
It does not include advanced statistical modeling (e.g., regression analysis) or predictive analytics. Future updates may address these gaps based on user feedback.
